# About me

I came across Python out of necessity.

Performing repetitive, sometimes almost duplicated tasks in many companies always puzzled me.

“There must be an easier way”, I thought.

I had read only a few things about Python back then.
I was nevertheless able to produce a script to handle csv flat files that used to be imported to excel for different validations. Had no more than 10 lines of code…

That was it for me, I was in love with Python!

And then I started diving into the extensive Libraries and Frameworks available today, tailored to so many domains and industries.
Most recently I took an interest in web development mainly through Django Web Framework.

Technology has always been fascinating to me but there are other things I like to do: 

I have lived in Mozambique and in the United Kingdom, travelling is one of my favourite things in live.
I love spending hours riding my bicycle, that’s how I come to know the places where I live.
Tennis and swimming are also an important part of my routine.
